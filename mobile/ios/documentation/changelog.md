v1.8.2  [MOD-1087] Updating attribution
	
v1.8.1	[MOD-603] Fixed useLED to properly report if the LED will be used. Also added a button to the example overlay for toggling it on and off.

v1.8	[MOD-434][MOD-439] Fixed a crash when scanning a VEVENT code, and improved the durability of scanning to not crash the application upon parse errors.
		- BREAKING CHANGE: iOS error event's property "reason" has been renamed to "message" for parity with Android and the documentation.

v1.7	[MOD-377] Fixed regression introduced by Titanium Mobile 1.8.1
		[MOD-403] Fixed crash after parsing an invalid barcode.

v1.6	[MOD-304] Added "acceptedFormats" and relevant constants. Check out the documentation and example to find out more.
		[MOD-202] Added "parse" method for finding barcodes in blobs. See documentation and example for more information.
		[MOD-250] Added "useLED" property to the module for lighting the LED during scanning, if available.

v1.5	[MOD-241][MOD-256] Added a "useFrontCamera" property to the module to control which camera is used.
		[MOD-254][MOD-253] "capture" now accepts the "keepOpen" boolean key. Check out the example and documentation to find out more.
		[MOD-90] "capture" now accepts several new keys: overlay, which takes a view; and showRectangle, which takes a boolean.
		[MOD-223] Established parity between iOS and Android Barcode modules.
		- BREAKING CHANGE: iOS now uses event listeners instead of callbacks! Use Ti.Barcode.addEventListener('success', ...) instead of capture({ success: ...})!
		- BREAKING CHANGE: Android's contentType property is now an integer, instead of a string! Check out the example and documentation to find out more.
		- BREAKING CHANGE: All automatically parsed "data" keys will now be lower case. This ensures consistency across the API and ease of access. 
		- BREAKING CHANGE: Android now properly fires the "cancel" event, as documented. It was firing the "canceled" event.
		- Updated examples to be identical; only difference is iOS's example utilizes the allowRotation property.
		- Added support for processing "WIFI" QR Codes.
		- Android now supports the "data" property, offering up a easy to use dictionary of the properties from the scanned barcode.
		- Android now has a "allowMenu" property on the module. See the documentation to find out more.
		- Updated example to use 'var' for module object returned from require.
		[MOD-293] Fixed issue with 'Cancel' button not displaying on capture screen
